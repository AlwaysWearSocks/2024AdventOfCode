Each 0 (called trailheads) within the grid has a score which represents how many unique 9s that trailhead can reach. Intuition to solve is to find each 0 and then queue up incremental (unique) digits until reaching 9, and then count how many were found and record the score. The sum of these scores should solve the problem"
